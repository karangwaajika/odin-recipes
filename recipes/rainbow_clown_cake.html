    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a cake about happiness, peace, and equality. There is nothing sad
      about rainbows and all those beautiful colors in harmony together. Happy
      Valentine's Day!, it's a popular request now with my colleagues! Frost
      with your favorite frosting and top with colored sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Food coloring gels and pastes are more concentrated than liquid food
      colorings and are necessary for this cake. They are available at craft
      stores and specialty kitchenware stores.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 egg whites</li>
      <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix</li>
      <li>1 â…“ cups water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>red paste food coloring</li>
      <li>orange paste food coloring</li>
      <li>yellow paste food coloring</li>
      <li>green paste food coloring</li>
      <li>blue paste food coloring</li>
      <li>purple paste food coloring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two
        8-inch round cake pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until frothy, about 1 minute.
        Add the cake mix, water, and canola oil; continue beating for 2 minutes
        on medium speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the cake batter into six separate bowls. Use a toothpick to scoop
        a dab of food coloring into one bowl of batter and stir; add more food
        coloring, if necessary, to reach the desired shade. Repeat with the
        remaining colors and bowls of batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop spoonfuls of batter into the prepared pans, alternating the
        colors. Use a toothpick to gently swirl the colors for a marbled effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake
        comes clean, about 30-35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before
        removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
      </li>
    </ol>
